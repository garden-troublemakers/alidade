@TODO :
 - collisions' tests
 - intersections' tests
 - teleportation
 - alpha blending textures
 - frameBuffer object
 
---

HOW TO COMPILE
Type './build.sh' to compile the files
Then launch the binary ./alidade inside the directory bin.

---

HOW TO PLAY
For now, you can move the player or a ghost camera in the scene.
The collisions' tests are triggered but the result seems invalid or unable to be received.
The intersections are computed too but there is an error somewhere.
